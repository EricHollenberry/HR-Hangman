# HR-Hangman
Project for Hack Reactor Admissions

During this project, I spent dozens of hours learning new material. First, through the Remote Prep course, 
I learned HTML and CSS. That was incredibly helpful in setting up the page.

Post interview, however, I realized that 
I didn't have a firm understanding of JS methods or higher order functions, so I made it a priority to take those apart,
work with them, and to use them in code. You can see this implementation several times throughout my code. 

I'm pretty proud of the fact that, upon user interaction, most of my functions call upon other functions, which has certainly improved my 
understanding of what previously felt abstract. Most of the pieces of my program involve functional interaction, as well as several instances of higher order functions,
method use, and some baby steps into jQuery.

With more time, there are certain aspects of my program that I would adjust. To name a few, I would like to add button submission,
a title, an HR logo in the corner, the inability to repeat a letter multiple times, x's across the bottom of the hangman image, the ability to add your own words, difficulty selection, and more.

However, due to my hope to re-apply in time for the October 5th cohort, I have submitted the working product as is, reflective of about 20 hours of work and 20 hours of additional learning (not including Remote Prep),
and am continuing to work on higher order functions and method rebuilding instead.

I hope that you enjoy it!
